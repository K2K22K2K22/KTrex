# KTrex 

**KTrex** is an interactive, terminal-based directory and file structure builder.  
It lets you visually create, navigate, undo, save, load, and reuse project layouts
directly from a curses-based TUI — safely and deterministically.

> Think: `mkdir` + `tree` + `undo` + `presets` + `resume`, all in one tool.

---

## Features

- Interactive terminal UI (arrow-key driven)
- Create directories and files visually
- Safe undo (never deletes non-empty directories)
- Presets (builtin or external JSON)
- Save project structure to JSON
- Load and resume saved structures
- Non-destructive by design (no overwrites, no forced deletes)
- Works offline, zero runtime dependencies
- Scrollable tree view (keyboard + mouse)

## Installation

### Using pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install KTrex
````

### Editable install (for development)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K2K22K2K22/KTrex.git
cd KTrex
pip install -e .
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run KTrex inside any directory:

```bash
KTrex
```

You’ll be dropped into an interactive TUI showing your project tree and available actions.

## Actions Explained

### Create Directory

* Creates a new directory in the current location
* Automatically enters the directory

### Create File

* Creates a file in the current directory
* Does **not** change navigation

### Undo

* Reverts the most recent create action
* Only removes files or **empty directories**
* Never deletes non-empty directories

### Load Preset

* Load a predefined structure by name or file path
* Presets are **additive**, never destructive

### Save Structure

* Serialize the entire project tree to a JSON file
* Useful for reuse, backups, or AI-assisted generation

### Load Structure

* Load a previously saved structure JSON
* Applies safely without removing existing files

### Go Back

* Navigate to parent directory
* Cannot escape project root

### Help

* View built-in documentation and keybindings

## Presets

### Built-in presets

```text
ml_project
```

Usage:

```
Load Preset → ml_project
```

### External presets

```text
Load Preset → /path/to/custom_preset.json
```

Preset format is documented below.

## Preset / Structure Format

KTrex uses a simple, declarative JSON format:

```json
{
  "name": "project",
  "type": "dir",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "src",
      "type": "dir",
      "children": [
        { "name": "main.py", "type": "file" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This format is shared by:

* presets
* saved structures
* AI-generated layouts

---

## Safety Guarantees

KTrex is designed to be **safe by default**:

* ❌ Never overwrites files
* ❌ Never deletes non-empty directories
* ❌ Never escapes project root
* ✅ Undo is leaf-only and predictable
* ✅ All destructive actions are explicit
